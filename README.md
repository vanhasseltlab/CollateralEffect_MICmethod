# CollateralEffect_MICmethod

This repository is for replication of the analysis of the manuscript 'Identification of antibiotic collateral sensitivity and resistance interactions in population surveillance data'. It includes an R project file which you can open in RStudio. The data and scripts are available. The R script (collateral_effect_detection.R) can be used for replication of the analysis and paper figures. The script depends on a custom package for collateral effects detection (collatRal), which can be installed by running the following line in R:

`devtools::install_github("vanhasseltlab/collatRal")`
